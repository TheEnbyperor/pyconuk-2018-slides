                First some background:

                Some of you may remember me from last year. Today's talk is somewhat of a continuation from that talk,
                however last years talk in not required to understand this one.

                Last year I had been working on a C compiler in python for the BBC micro and at the time it was a bit
                of a mess and couldn't really do much. Since then I've had a year to work on it and it can actually
                compile some useful things now. But that's not the subject of this talk so if you want to go learn about
                that you can watch my talk at ACCU.

                Now I know what you're thinking; How can you possibly get python on a Beeb? Python 3.7 is 5MiB in size
                and the Beeb only has 32Kib of RAM and only about half of that is usable at best. Well obviously some
                compromises had to be made.

                Some of you might have heard of MicroPython. It's the version of python that runs on the micro:bit,
                but there's still a problem. MicroPython takes 16KiB of RAM, brilliant! It'll fit! Well, no. It also
                takes 256KiB of program space, so no it won't. My solution was to write my own implementation of python.

                    Anyway, back to python. We can have a peek into the python internals with the `dis` module.
                    By calling the dis function we can see the compiled part of python. This is python bytecode, which
                    gets executed by the python virtual machine. All of the dynamic typing and fanciness of python is
                    handled by the VM so the compiler itself isn't complicated by compiler standards.

                    >>> code = compile("40+2", '', 'eval')

                    The data isn't stored in the VM as it is displayed by the dis module. We can see its internal
                    representation using the built in `compile` function. This generates a code object that the VM would
                    then use to run the program.

                    The `co_code` attribute of the object shows us the byte representation of the code. Bytecode is
                    really like assembly language, but for a generic portable architecture. Each instruction is 1 byte
                    long and usually takes 1 byte as an argument.

                    We can see that `LOAD_CONST` has a value of 100, with an argument of 0. That 0 is an index into an
                    array of constants stored next the bytecode, referencing 40. Then we see it again with an argument
                    of 1 referencing 2.

                    Next is 23 which is `BINARY_ADD`, with an argument of 0. I actually don't know why that would ever
                    be anything other than 0 so why is it there? I could probably find out after a few days of looking
                    at the source code. This will take the two values and add them together.

                    Next is 83 which is `RETURN_VALUE`, which in this case gives the value back to the REPL to print.

                    | LOAD_CONST (40) |  40   |   |
                    | LOAD_CONST (2)  |  40   | 2 |
                    |   BINARY_ADD    |  42   |   |
                    |  RETURN_VALUE   |       |   |

                <aside class="notes">
                    Now you might be wondering how the values 40 and 2 got from `LOAD_CONST` to `BINARY_ADD` and then 42
                    to `RETURN_VALUE`. The answer is the python stack. A stack is a fundamental data structure in
                    computing. A stack is a LIFO buffer, in that the last item pushed is the first item popped.

                    The python virtual machine is stack based, in that all instruction make modifications to the stack.
                    So the two `LOAD_CONST` put their respective constant values on the stack, the `BINARY_ADD` pops
                    the two values off the top and puts the result back on the stack. Finally `RETURN_VALUE` pops the
                    value on the top of the stack into function that called this code, in this case the REPL.

                    Then there's the array itself with a byte pointer to the actual data. The reason I put ArrayMeta in
                    a separate struct is a way of implementing generics in C, I don't have time to explain in detail
                    so come talk to me afterwards if you want an explanation.

                    In C arrays are really just glorified pointers so we can just use `data` like an array.

                    that happens in them, way more that I could've understood from reading glibc's source code. Their
                    malloc is 5611 lines long last time I checked, in comparison mine is 169 lines long. Mine has a
                    significantly simpler algorithm (simple first-fit as opposed to a complicated mix of mmap, first-fit
                    and best fit), and also can hand out memory as it wishes without having to interface to the OS
                    (because there is none).

                    So what does a memory allocator actually do? When a program starts it has all of system memory
                    available to it, but has no idea what to do with it. Wheres this string going to be stored, what
                    about that class, that cat gif? It's a memory allocators job to (efficiently) find space to store
                    objects in memory.

                    This is why in C you have to be very explicit about variables and memory, because there's nothing to
                    manage it at runtime.

                    Skipping ahead a little, we now have a dynamic array with VM opcode bytes in it, but how is that
                    interpreted. If we look at the cpython source code (available on github) we can see that it's
                    nothing more than a giant (and I mean giant, a couple thousand lines at least) switch statement.

                    If we now have a look at my code, we can see the logic is very similar. Read a byte, figure out
                    the instruction and execute it. Some of you may have noticed this is an if instead of a switch,
                    the only reason being that my C compiler doesn't support switch statements yet.
