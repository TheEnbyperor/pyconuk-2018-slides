                First some background:

                Some of you may remember me from last year. Today's talk is somewhat of a continuation from that talk,
                however last years talk in not required to understand this one.

                Last year I had been working on a C compiler in python for the BBC micro and at the time it was a bit
                of a mess and couldn't really do much. Since then I've had a year to work on it and it can actually
                compile some useful things now. But that's not the subject of this talk so if you want to go learn about
                that you can watch my talk at ACCU.

                Now I know what you're thinking; How can you possibly get python on a Beeb? Python 3.7 is 5MiB in size
                and the Beeb only has 32Kib of RAM and only about half of that is usable at best. Well obviously some
                compromises had to be made.

            <aside class="notes">
                Some of you might have heard of MicroPython. It's the version of python that runs on the micro:bit,
                but there's still a problem. MicroPython takes 16KiB of RAM, brilliant! It'll fit! Well, no. It also
                takes 256KiB of program space, so no it won't. My solution was to write my own implementation of python.

                The first step in writing an implementation of python is to learn how python works internally.

                Python is a somewhat confusing language in that it is both compiled and interpreted. It's not like BASIC
                that purely interpreted, but it's also not like C that purely compiled.

                Side note: The BBC Micro and BBC Basic that runs on it were co-designed by Sophie Wilson who is trans,
                which is awesome! She also designed the ARM chip that now powers probably every phone in this room.

                Anyway, back to python. We can have a peek into the python internals with the `dis` module.
                By calling the dis function we can see the compiled part of python. This is python bytecode, which gets
                executed by the python virtual machine. All of the dynamic typing and fanciness of python is handled by
                the VM so the compiler itself isn't complicated by compiler standards.
